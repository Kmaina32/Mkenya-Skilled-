### Abstract

A system and method for an adaptive e-learning platform that utilizes artificial intelligence to generate course content, provide real-time tutoring, and automate administrative tasks. The system features a modular architecture, including a course generation module, an interactive AI tutor, and an automated grading and feedback mechanism, all designed to create a personalized and scalable learning experience.

### Background of the Invention

Traditional online learning platforms often provide a one-size-fits-all approach to education. Content is static, and student support is limited and not scalable. There exists a need for a more dynamic, interactive, and personalized educational tool that can adapt to individual learning styles and provide immediate, context-aware support. Furthermore, the administrative burden of creating and managing course content and grading assessments is a significant bottleneck for educators.

### Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides a novel e-learning platform that addresses these shortcomings. The system uses a generative AI model to create comprehensive course curricula from simple prompts. It integrates an AI tutor, "Gina," within the learning interface, capable of answering student questions, providing summaries, and generating quizzes on-demand. The platform also features an AI-assisted grading tool that automates the assessment of student submissions, providing both a score and qualitative feedback. This combination of features significantly enhances the learning process for students and streamlines content management for administrators.

### Detailed Description of the Invention

The system comprises several key modules:

1.  **AI Course Generation Module:** An administrator provides a course title. The system, using a connection to a large language model (LLM) via a framework like Genkit, generates a full course structure including modules, lessons with detailed text and video links, and a final exam with various question types.

2.  **Interactive AI Tutor ("Gina"):** Within a lesson, a student can interact with an AI tutor. The student's query and the lesson's text are sent to the LLM. The LLM is prompted to act as a tutor, providing answers based only on the provided lesson context. This ensures relevance and accuracy. The tutor can also perform specific actions like "summarize" or "quiz me".

3.  **AI-Assisted Grading Module:** For open-ended exam questions, a student's answer, the question, and a pre-defined reference answer are sent to the LLM. The model is prompted to compare the student's answer to the reference answer and return a suggested score and detailed feedback, which an administrator can then approve.

4.  **Autonomous Content Strategy Agent:** An automated process, triggerable via a cron job, that uses the AI to brainstorm new course ideas, generate full content for them, and package them into marketable programs and bundles, ensuring the platform's content library continuously grows.

### Claims

**What is claimed is:**

1.  A computer-implemented method for providing an AI-powered educational platform, the method comprising:
    *   Receiving a course title from an administrator;
    *   Generating, via a large language model, a complete course curriculum including modules, lessons, and an exam based on said title;
    *   Presenting said lessons to a student user;
    *   Providing an interactive AI tutor within the lesson interface, configured to answer student queries based on the context of the presented lesson;
    *   Grading a student's exam submission using an AI model to compare the student's answer against a reference answer.

2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the AI tutor is further configured to provide summaries of the lesson content upon user request.

3.  The method of claim 1, wherein the AI-assisted grading provides both a quantitative score and qualitative feedback.

4.  A system for providing AI-powered education, comprising:
    *   A database for storing course and user data;
    *   A server configured to communicate with a large language model;
    *   A user interface for students to access courses;
    *   An administrator interface for managing content;
    *   Wherein the server is configured to execute the method of claim 1.
