# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
      Initialize a new Git repository: Open a terminal in your project's root directory and run:

git init -b main

Add all the files to staging:

git add .

Create your first commit: This saves a snapshot of the current state of your project.

git commit -m "Initial commit"

Add your GitHub repository as a remote: This tells Git where you want to push your code.

git remote add origin https://github.com/Kmaina32/Mkenya-Skilled-

Push your code to GitHub: This uploads your commit to the main branch on GitHub.

git push -u origin main
